# Simple Todo App

The Simple Todo App enables users to input and list items with their due dates, mark them as completed by checkbox, and delete and add more items as desired.

## Functionality

When users click the "+Add Todo" button and a popup will appear. The user can enter a todo item and add a due date (optional) into the corresponding input fields. The form will validate the input as the user enters or removes characters. By clicking the "Create" button, the new line item will appear on the todo list. The user can mark the item as done by clicking the checkbox. Items can be deleted by simply clicking "Delete."
